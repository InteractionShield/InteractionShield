The time and memory consumption of the Conflicts Detector and Conflicts Resolver, as well as the performance overhead of adding a single rule, were evaluated under scenarios involving 5 and 25 apps. The results show that the overhead remains acceptable, with adding a rule causing only a slight increase in both time and memory usage. This demonstrates that the system scales efficiently, incurring minimal overhead even as rule complexity grows.
