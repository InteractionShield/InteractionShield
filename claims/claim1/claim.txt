We validated the accuracy of InteractionShield by conducting a direct comparison with two publicly available tools: IoTCom and IoTSan. For a broader comparison with other existing works, we relied on their reported results. Tables 16 and 17 present detailed app descriptions and the complete results identified by our tool. Our tool identifies all conflicts, whereas previous work missed many.
