To evaluate the large-scale conflict detection capabilities of InteractionShield, we conducted experiments using a dataset of 6,975 real-world IoT apps. In each experiment, we randomly selected groups of 5 to 25 apps from the dataset and assumed that all physical connections were valid. Each experiment was repeated 2,000 times to calculate the average number of conflicts per group. 
Our findings show that Contradictory Action is the most frequently detected interaction threat, with deterministic rule conflicts occurring far less often than conditional ones. Among deterministic conflicts, Chain-related conflicts are the most prevalent. We also discovered conflicts caused by Force Action, a type of conflict not previously reported in other studies. Our analysis revealed that approximately 2.27% of all conflicts can be attributed to Force Action.

We plot the average number of rules against the average penalty change, the results show that the penalty change is linearly related to the number of rules. Based on this
relationship.
