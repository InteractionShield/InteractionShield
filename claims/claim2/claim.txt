Our tool leverages an efficient graph search algorithm, eliminating the need for time-consuming model checks. As a result, it requires only 0.05 seconds to analyze 25 apps with single rules, whereas IoTCom requires 242.98 seconds and IoTSan requires 278.98 seconds, achieving a reduction of over 99% in detection time compared to the other tools. As shown in Figure 2(b), our tool also identifies the largest number of potential conflicts, demonstrating its detection capability.
